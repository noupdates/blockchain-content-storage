![Blockchain storage dashboard](./Screenshot.png)

This is a posting system where content can be posted to Arweave network and stored permanently.

A work for 2022 HackKing's - annual hackathon of King's College London.

Built on 19 Nov 2022 at Bush House, London.

### Notice:

- Your content will be posted to Arweave blockchain network; this tool will not store your content, instead, it posts your content to the blockchain for permanent storage.

- The key of an Arweave wallet (all content of the wallet's ```.json``` file) with ```AR token``` balance is needed to pay blockchain transaction fee for each posting action.
