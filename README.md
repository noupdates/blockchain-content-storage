## Blockchain Storage System on Arweave Network
![Blockchain storage dashboard](./Screenshot.png)

This is a blockchain storage system that allows users to post content to the Arweave Network for permanent storage.

This project was developed for the 2022 HackKing's annual hackathon at King's College London.

Built on: November 19, 2022, at Bush House (S), London.

### Notice:

- Your content will be posted to the Arweave blockchain network; this tool does not store your content locally. Instead, it posts your content to the blockchain for permanent storage.

- You will need the key from an Arweave wallet (including all content from the wallet's `.json` file) with an `AR token` balance to pay the blockchain transaction fee for each posting action.
